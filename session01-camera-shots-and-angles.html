                <h1>1. Preparation</h1>

                <p>
                    Work through all the content from today's activity to get a feel for how each of its parts - the Camera Shot Sizes, Camera Angles, and Story Project - looks and for how those parts work together. Review this lesson plan, as well, to make sure you're comfortable facilitating it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be sure to test your technology and Internet connectivity if you're showing examples from the net.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Distribute markers, sticky notes and paper to all your learners so that they have tools to brainstorm the next exercises and activities.
                </p>
                <h2>Ice-breaker micro-activity</h2>
                <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>
                <p>Ask your learners: <b>What movie have you seen recently that you really enjoyed?</b> and have them place their answer on sticky notes and fix them to the flipchart. After they all answer, do a little gallery walk with them through the available answers and let them <b>+1</b> movies they also enjoyed. Get them talking why they liked each movie.</p>
                <p>This will allow you to learn what types of movies they like the most, you can then later frame all your examples from the same movies thus keeping them engaged.</p>

                <h1>2. Discovering Camera Shot Sizes</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                <p>
                    Welcome your learners and explain that today we'll begin learning how to become VideoLoggers/YouTubbers. In this first session we'll explore some movie-making techniques and learn how to tell stories with pictures.</p>
                <p>
                    The language of movies uses both audio and video to do storytelling and even though we are all already subconsciously familiar with such mechanics, we'll learn about them in a more conscious way. <b>After today's session, they will never look to a movie the same way again.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our focus for this session is camera shot sizes and angles. We'll explore each category separately beginning with shot sizes.
                <blockquote>
                    A camera shot is defined by the series of film frames that run for a given period of time. Once the photographer decides which camera position they will use for a given shot, all that is contained within the frame is part of the story and the decision about such placement affect the narrative of the movie.
                </blockquote>
                In our session, we'll focus on defining these shots by the field size which means that they vary by the content size of captured image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are <b>four basic</b> kinds of shots with which we can tell any kind of story. In this <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/andregarzia/54845/">page we explain each of them and what is their narrative use</a>. There is also <a href="http://learnaboutfilm.com/film-language/picture/shotsize/">this other resource explaining shot sizes</a> which is very good.
                </p>
                <h2>Explanation to learners</h2>
                <p>
                    Explain each type of shot to your learners by using subjects from your surroundings. For example, if your club takes place inside a school, tell them how a scene of a student curious of the whereabouts of their best friend could be framed:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a <b>long shot</b> would show the whole school, framing the location of the scene.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a <b>full shot</b> would show a group of students talking thus presenting the characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a <b>medium shot</b> could focus on a specific student thus framing the protagonist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a <b>close-up, or, details shot</b> could show the protagonis typing a message on a mobile device.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>And how each of these shots alone could not convey the whole story but the sum of them can be used to link the narrative together.
                </p>
                <h2>Micro-activity with learners</h2>
                <p>Give them more examples of possible shot sizes that make sense inside your venue and ask them to provide examples as well. With their mood up with creativity, do:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Divide your learners in groups of four or five.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give them time to think about a scene that could take place inside your venue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let them think of their scene in terms of a series of four different shots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let each group present (verbally) their scene in terms of their chosen shot sizes as was done above with the example from the school.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this little exercise, tell them that there are other factors that influence a camera shot besides the shot size and begin the explanation about camera angles.
                </p>


            </li> <!-- end of step-->

            <li>
                <h1>3. Understanding Camera Angles</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Another important aspect of cinematography is deciding on the camera angle to be used on a given shot. Camera angles or positions, work along shot sizes to generate mood and significance for a narrative. In our activity we'll explore just a couple different positions even though there are many more positions and angles to be used in a movie.</p>
                <p>Use this <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/andregarzia/56134/">page explaining different camera angles and their usage</a> to get familiar with the subject. If you want to go deeper into the subject, check out <a href="http://learnaboutfilm.com/film-language/picture/camera-position/">this very useful resource about camera positions and angles</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(filmmaking)">camera placement section of this wikipedia page</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Explanation to learners</h2>
                <p>Tell them how different camera positions affect the mood of the scene. Use a camera or smartphone to take pictures of you and them with varying camera angles to show how their perception is affected.</p>
                <p>
                    Provide them with examples from common cultural items from their background context such as super-hero comics:
                <ul>
                    <li>Show them how heroes such as supergirl is always shown from an <b>low angle</b> with the camera pointing upwards thus making her look more corageous and important.</li>
                    <li>How comic relief characters are usually shown from <b>a high angle</b> with the camera pointing downwards thus making them look more harmless and weak.</li>
                    <li>How normal people are shown from an <b>eye-level position, or, neutral angle</b> thus making them look just like normal people except when they are in peril which is usually shown from, you guessed, a <b>high angle</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Using the same personal example as the one used in the previous section (aka the student looking for their friend), explain how camera angles provide the scene with more mood.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <b>long shot</b> from the school could be taken from an <b>aerial view</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <b>full shot</b> from the students using an high angle, as if taken from a second floor of the given school.</li>
                    <li>The <b>medium shot</b> on the protagonist from a low angle thus conveying its importance.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Micro-activity with learners</h2>
                <p>
                    Tell learners to reassemble in the same groups as before and have them:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Remix their previous scene by exploring new camera positions and angles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let each group present (verbally) their remixed scene in terms of their chosen shot sizes and angles as was done above with the example from the school.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>After this quick exercise, we'll move to our large project of the day!</p>

            </li> <!-- end of step-->

            <li>
                <h1>4. Telling a Story</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

                <p>Now that you and your leaners know all about shot sizes, positions and angles and have played with the ideation of a small scene, it is time to move to our larger project for the day.</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide your learners into four or five groups. Ideally, you should use different groups then before so that they will be working on a new story with a new group.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have them brainstorm a new scene that they can do at the venue and its safe surroundings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let each group plan a series of 4 to 5 photos that form their scene.</li>
                    <li>
                        Allow each group, paired with a facilitator, to walk around the venue and take photos with cameras or smartphones to bring their story to life. Let each member of the group coordinate one photo so that they all get to play the role of <i>director</i>, have them be the actors as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once all groups finish taking their photos, you can either let each group present their scene to the rest of the learners or depending on their web literacy skills, have them place the photos on <a href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/3995/remix">this thimble comics template</a> forming their scene.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>



            </li> <!-- end of step-->

                <h1>5. Reflection and Assessment</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

                <p>Finally, facilitate a brief, reflective discussion about the day's learning using prompts like these - or make your own!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In your own words, can you describe how movies use camera shot sizes and angles to create stories?</li>
                    <li>As a videologger how could you use what you learned today to make your channel more interesting?</li>
                    <li>What are the shot sizes most useful for the area that you want to talk about?</li>
                    <li>Can you name some good sequence of shot sizes and angles used in a movie you watched that was great?</li>
                    <li>Was it difficult to create your scene?</li>
                    <li>Now that you know the narrative meaning of each kind of shot, how does this affect your movie watching experience?</li>
                    <li>How would you improve this lesson?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can record learners' responses for the purpose of assessment, as well, but be sure to do so in a way that doesn't disadvantage those who struggle with composing in any particular medium. For example, be ready to record spoken answers, as well as to read typed or written responses.</p>
