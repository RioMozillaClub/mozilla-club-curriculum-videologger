                <h1>1. Preparation</h1>

                <p>
                    Work through all the content from today's activity to get a feel for how each of its parts work together. Review this lesson plan, as well, to make sure you're comfortable facilitating it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The objective of this activity is to do a series of group dynamics and ideation practices to boost the groups creativity while planning for a future video channel. This makes only sense if your learners want to create their own video channel. For the purposes of this activity, we're considering a single video channel for the group where everyone contribute to the same channel but not necessarily the same videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mozilla Clubs in Rio de Janeiro, operate inside Internet Cafes called LAN Houses which are mainly used by young people wanting to play online games and browse social networks. This activity was created to help them plan for the LAN House video channel.

                <h1>2. Channels we like</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

                <h2>Introduction for facilitators</h2>
                <p>The objective of this dynamic is to find out which types of channel your learners enjoy. The rest of the day can be framed upon the choices made here.</p>
                <p>This is a very loose activity, feel free to improvise ;-)</p>
                <h2>Part one: Channels we like</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Step #1:</b> Ask your learners which video channels they follow regularly or enjoy occasionally. Have them place the name of the channels on individual post-it notes and hang them onto the flipchart.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Step #2:</b> Once you have enough channels listed, work with them to come out with a classification system to categorize those channels into different groups. You can create your own categories, here in Brazil we divided out list in <i>humor, gaming, music, slice of life</i>.</li>
                <li><b>Step #3:</b> Draw columns or regions in your flipchart for the different categories you selected. Move the post-it notes for each channel in the most appropriate category.</li>
                <li><b>Step #4:</b> Once all is neat and organized into different categories, let them do a gallery walk and plus one the channels they also like.</li>
                <li><b>Step #5:</b> Find out which categories they like the most and start a conversation with them why they like them.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Part two: why we like them</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Step #1:</b> flip to a new page on the flipchart and divide it like the previous one with the same categories. The page should ressemble the previous page but without the post-it notes.</b></li>
                <li><b>Step #2:</b> Ask them why they like videos in each category. Have them write as many post-it notes as needed. They should write the note and hang them to the flipchart in the region they are talking about.</li>
                <li><b>Step #4: </b> Do a gallery walk with them so they can <i>plus one</i> notes they agree with. Encourage them to help you find out which post-it notes contains the most important and common reasons.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>


            </li> <!-- end of step-->

            <li>
                <h1>3. Priorities spectogram</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is an activity for gauging learners priorities and preferrences regarding video channels. It works by giving them two options and having them physically move towards one option or the other thus allowing you to verify where their preferrences lie.</p>
                <p>Besides the list of questions we have here, you should use post-it notes from the previous activity as material for this activity. Keep track of the options and their selections by writing them on the flipchart. Be aware that the options presented are not always opposite to one another, they are there to spur creativity and discussion, in many cases both option items are possible.</p>
                <p>Besides having them move towards their selected option, have them talk about each question for some minutes among themselves.</p>
                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you prefer long or short videos?</li>
                    <li>Do you prefer serious in-depth videos or fun light ones?</li>
                    <li>What is more important: video quality or charisma?</li>
                    <li>A video channel should be updates as often as possible with a regular schedule or only when there is good material with an irregular schedule?</li>
                    <li>How many presenters should be on a video channel? One or many?</li>
                <li>A video channel should have a single theme or can it have more than one? (themes are the categories from the previous activity) </li>
                </ul>
                </p>

            </li> <!-- end of step-->

            <li>
                <h1>4. Ideation time</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

                <h2>Introduction for the facilitators</h2>
                <p>This is a very informal and loose activity. It works best the more time you give your learners to work on it.</p>
                <h2>A dream circle (10 to 15 minutes)</h2>
                <p>Pick any object from the venue, call it the dream stick. Make a circle, the dream stick will pass from person to person. When it is someones turn with the dream stick they should state their dream for the video channel.</p>
                <p>Start with your facilitators dreams so that your learners get the gist of the activity. Dreams should be stated in a phrase, such as <i>"My dream is that our channel has one million subscribers!"</i> or <i>"My dream is that our web development videos help people become creators!"</i> and so on. Remember to write down all dream phrases in the flipchart for everyone to read, as your dreams pile up, you may need more sheets.</p>
                <p>You should go round the circle multiple times, ideally until there are no more dreams but at least three times if you are running short of time.</p>
                <h2>Breakout groups and brainstorming (15 to 20 minutes)</h2>
                <p>The previous activity will get their excitement up! Break them up into groups that share the same category preferrences, such as a group that like <i>game streaming videos</i>. Give them markers and blank paper.</p>
                <p>Have them work freely on their ideas for their channels using all they reasoned about today. Have them decide if the channel should have long or short videos, how many presenters, which format, etc. Let them free to ideate about their category but <b>ask one thing of them as deliverables to be talked about later: "describe your first three videos".</b></p>
                <p>At the end have each group present their answers to the question above to each other. Encourage them to keep working on their plans for the channels at their own time after the event.</p>

                <h1>5. Reflection and Assessment</h1>
                <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

                <p>Finally, facilitate a brief, reflective discussion about the day's learning using prompts like these - or make your own!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In your own words, can you describe what you like about video channels?</li>
                    <li>What do you think is the most important <i>thing</i> for a video channel?</li>
                    <li>Who has plans to start their own channel?</li>
                    <li>How would you improve this lesson?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can record learners' responses for the purpose of assessment, as well, but be sure to do so in a way that doesn't disadvantage those who struggle with composing in any particular medium. For example, be ready to record spoken answers, as well as to read typed or written responses.</p>
